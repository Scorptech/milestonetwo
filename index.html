			<h2>Context</h2>
			<p>An asteroid's orbit is computed by finding the elliptical path about the sun that best fits
				the available observations of the object. That is, the object's computed path about the sun is adjusted
				until the predictions of where the asteroid should have
				appeared in the sky at several observed times match the positions where the object was actually observed
				to be at those same times. As more and more observations
				are used to further improve an object's orbit, we become more and more confident in our knowledge of
				where the object will be in the future.
				When the discovery of a new near Earth asteroid is announced by the Minor Planet Center, Sentry
				automatically prioritizes the object for an impact risk analysis.
				If the prioritization analysis indicates that the asteroid cannot pass near the Earth or that its orbit
				is very well determined, the computationally intensive nonlinear
				search for potential impacts is not pursued. If, on the other hand, a search is deemed necessary then
				the object is added to a queue of objects awaiting analysis. Its
				position in the queue is determined by the estimated likelihood that potential impacts may be found.</p>

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<p>Sentry is a highly automated collision monitoring system that continually scans the most
				current asteroid catalog for possibilities of future impact with Earth over the next 100 years. This
				dataset includes the Sentry system's list of possible asteroid
				impacts with Earth and their probability, in addition to a list of all known near Earth asteroids and
				their characteristics.</p>
			<h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p>The asteroid
			orbit and impact risk data was collected by NASA's Near Earth Object Program at the Jet Propulsion
			Laboratory (California Institute of Technology).</p>
