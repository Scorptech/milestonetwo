Over the last few years, the media has been very vocal about near earth objects and the proximity of them regarding the planet. So with the “Impact Earth” website, I have listed a number of known asteroids, the dates when they are due and other details regarding their size, speed and impact potential. 

#### The goals of this website are:

-   To give people information relating to potential issues with near earth objects
-   Give visitors an uncluttered, easy to use and graphically pleasing website experience
-   To allow visitors to request more information about this data via the contact form

#### The goals of this website are:

-   The visitor to be able to search for information about near earth objects.
-   Clear easy navigation.
-   Details information about the size, speed and the impact posibilities.

## UX

#### Ideal visitor

#### The ideal visitor for this website is:

-   English speaking.
-   Interested in space, science and near earth objects
-   Can understand and read charts  
-   Can use a contact form 

#### Visitors to this website are searching for:

-   Information related to near earth objects 
-   Information regarding the system that is used by NASA to monitor near earth objects called Sentry

#### This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:

As this website is a general website, no particular colour scheme was required however, the header image does give the visitor an idea of what the website is about. 

-   Most websites do not offer charts to display statistical information.
-   The visitor also has the opportunity to contact the owner for more information 

#### This website is:

-   Easy to navigate.
-   Easy to understand and navigate the information.
-   Gives the visitor the general information.
-   Gives the visitor the option to send a request/query via the contact form.

#### Wireframe mockups:

* [Home Page](https://github.com/Scorptech/milestonetwo/blob/master/wireframe/wireframe.jpg)

After completing MS1, I decided to follow the same design for MS2 and have everything on one page (mobile first). 


## Features

The website has a static header image at the **Top** and also the **Social media Icons** at the bottom.  It features a responsive **navigation bar**. The website has a **footer** with **copyright information** and **social media icons** linking to 6 social media pages.

The website has **consistent design**.

#### Home

The Home page features a **static header image** which gives the visitor an idea of what the site is about when arriving to the website. The image is of an asteroid impacting the earth.

#### The Charts

The chart section features **Charts** displaying four different types of charts (Bar, Pie, Line and Horizontal Bar) with various details regarding seven asteroids.

Seeing statistical data in a simple chart format makes it easier to understand the information.

##### Contact
The Contact section features a **contact form**, which gives the visitor the option to leave a query/message. The bottom of the form contains a **Send Button**

The contact page form is working and was setup using the Emailjs free service and sends an email via an SMTP server to a predefined email address.
