The idea for this mock up website came about when speaking a builder that completed a number of projects for my family over the last few years.  The builders name is “Willie” and he is highly recommended by everyone as his workmanship and project management skills have always been spot on, hence why he is always in demand to a level that he would only need a website for internet presence, not for work. 

After having Willie complete some work for a family member I found out that having a website for internet presence is something that he would like to do but he just does not have the time to allocate to it. So for my first milestone project, I wanted to design a mock up website for Willie so the next time I see him, I could show him.

His business is unique as he offers a “turnkey” solution. So instead of customers hiring a builder, plumber, electrician etc, Willie can come in and project manage the development as he has his own team of people covering all the areas required for construction. This takes a huge amount of stress off the customer. 

Normally companies would have a photo gallery of previous work but we all know that some of these companies download library images for their website, hence why there is no photo gallery of previous work on the website. Willie prefers customers to personally view his previous work that he completed. In most cases, this is how he targets new business - people see his work and then they contact him. 

So the website is purely for customers who just want to get a ball park figure regarding costs. They can then decide if they want to move forward after Willie has given them an estimate. In most cases, this is what people want to know i.e. What is the cost and how long will it take?

#### The goals of this website are:

-   To give people informaion relating some of the potential issues with near earth objects
-   The give viewers an uncluttered, easy to use and graphically pleasing website experience
-   To allow customer to request more information about this data via the contact form

#### The goals of this website are:

-   Searching for a building company that can offer a “turnkey” solution for their project.
-   Clear easy navigation.
-   Information that they are members of the builders & tradesman Guild for peace of mind

## UX

#### Ideal client

#### The ideal client for this business is:

-   English speaking.
-   Have approved funding for the project they require
-   Have approved building plans  
-   Are happy to leave Willie and his team to get on with the work without micro-managing 
-   Understands that building regulations can affect the cost of a project  

#### Visitors to this website are searching for:

-   A company that can offer a turnkey solution and manage their project from start to finish
-   Being patient regarding their quote request as building regulation information might need to be researched before an            estimated quote is provided

#### This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:

As this website is based on the building and construction industry, the color yellow is highly significant as this relates to the likes of JCB equipment, clothes and DeWalt hardware like drills and power saws etc. So the theme had to revolve around this colour scheme. 

-   Most builders do not have a website.
-   Most of the builders websites on the internet that are active, do not offer a turnkey solution
-   You will be given the option to visit work completed with previous customers.

#### This website is:

-   Easy to navigate.
-   Easy to understand and navigate the information.
-   Gives the client the ability to request a quote 24/7.
-   Guiding them to the goal of the website – request a quote or fill out the contact form.

#### Client stories

1.  As a new visitor to the website, I want to easily navigate the site and feel comfortable with the builder and his commitment 
2.  As a new visitor to the website, I want the ability to request a quote for some construction work I require. A ball park figure is all I need now, which will             determine whether I go ahead with the construction. 
3.  As a potential client, I want the option to view the builders previous work and speak to existing customers regarding the service they received.
6.  As an interested client, I want to understand what might be involved in a project before I make an decisions. The ability to request a quote means that I will            receive information that will give me an initial idea as to whether I can proceed with the project.
7.  As an interested client, I want an "easy to fill" contact form, so I can make contact with the builder should I need general building information.
8.  As an interested observer and/or potential client, I want to follow the builder on social media to keep up with his latest news.
9.  As a returning visitor to the website, who has already decided to contact the builder using the contact form, I want to be able to find the request a quote based on      my initial enquiry.
